Everyone must create a new public GitHub repository (e.g., my-github-practice) and initialize it with a README.md file.

In the README, you must add a “Contributors” section that includes your full name and a hyperlinked email address using markdown syntax, and commit this change to the main branch. You should also add your instructors name and hyperlink with this link: github.com/mubarraqqq 

Next, you will create a new branch (e.g., feature/my-module) and add a Python file (my_module.py) containing at least two simple functions, such as a text reverser or a calculator, etc. This file should be committed to the new branch.

You will then open a pull request (PR) to merge your branch into main, write a short description for the PR, and assign it to yourself.

You must review the changes using GitHub’s interface, add at least one comment on a line of code, approve the PR, and merge it into the main branch. Finally, you will verify that the main branch reflects all changes.

Throughout the entire process from branch creation all the way to main branch verification, you are required to record your screen, clearly showing each step from repository creation to final merge.

The video should include your visible GitHub username, match the name used in the README, and not exceed 2 minutes in length. So practice thoroughly before recording.

This screen recording will then be uploaded to a Google Drive, and the link will be included in the form. Your GitHub repo link as well will be included in the Google Forms.
